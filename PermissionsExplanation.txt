1. Explain the different types of permissions you assigned (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and what each allows a user to do.
SELECT - Allows a user to read data from a table or view. The user can query rows but cannot modify data.
INSERT - Allows a user to add new rows to a table. Existing data cannot be changed or removed.
UPDATE - Allows a user to modify existing rows in a table. This can be limited to specific columns.
DELETE - Allows a user to remove rows from a table. It does not allow inserting or modifying data.

2. Describe the concept of schema-level permissions vs. table-level permissions.
Schema-level permissions - apply to all objects within a schema (tables, views, functions). They are used to control access broadly, such as allowing a role to read all tables in a schema.
Table-level permissions - apply to a specific table only. They provide fine-grained control over who can read or modify data in that individual table.
The main difference is that schema-level permissions are broader and easier to manage and the table-level permissions are more granular and restrictive.

3. Explain how column-level permissions work and why they might be useful.
Column-level permissions allow granting access to specific columns within a table, typically for SELECT or UPDATE. A user can be allowed to read or update certain columns while being denied access to others. The main features: it can protect sensitive data (e.g., SSN, salary, passwords)and allow users to work with required data only, without exposing confidential fields.

4. Discuss the principle of least privilege and how it's applied in this RBAC setup.
The principle of least privilege means granting users only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious data modification

5. Explain the potential security benefits of using roles instead of assigning permissions directly to users.
Security benefits of using roles instead of direct user permissions are:
   a. Centralized management: Permissions are defined once per role, not per user.
   b. Reduced errors: Less risk of misconfiguring individual user permissions.
   c. Consistency: Users with the same role always have identical access.
   d. Scalability: Easier to add, remove, or modify access as users change roles.
   e. Auditability: Roles make it easier to review and understand access control.
